Tamanoir aims to be a customer oriented bug tracker / helpdesk. The goal is to provide
a solution where a company can collect tickets from its customer and resolve the tickets. The system should allow customer to create tickets and visualize it, add comments to the ticket and close it if need be.

Administrators should be able to create companies, users and link them together. A user account should be able to create tickets for one or more companies.

## Why another bug-tracker / helpdesk ?
The goal here is purely educational - I am currently learning how to use Phoenix and the best way to gain experience is to develop such a project. The project is simple enough to get me going fast but it is deep enough that i can learn a great deal out of it. 
The final stack will look like the mighty PETAL (Phoenix Elixir Tailwind AlpineJS Liveview) - V1 will probably be only PET

## What's the plan ? 
Get a first version ready as soon as possible without any liveview, get it running on a free-tier cloud instance (Like Gigalixir).

Then i will move on adding features with Liveview to give the app a touch of SPA.

## What does Tamanoir means ? 
It's the french word for "Giant Anteater", this cute animal that eats ants and termites (Which are bugs :) )
